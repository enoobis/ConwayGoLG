This will start the GUI for the Game of Life, and you can click the "Run" button to start the game. You can also click the "Reset" button to reset the game to its initial state.

## Customization

You can customize the size of the grid and the initial state of the game by changing the values of the `GRID_SIZE` and `create_grid()` variables in the `gameoflife.py` file.

## Credits
